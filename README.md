Sales Forecasting by using Excel Solver
The primary objective of the retailer game is to develop a strategic markdown pricing plan to maximize total revenue over a 15-week selling season. The sales data includes weekly information about the price charged, the number of units sold, and the remaining inventory at the end of each week. There are four possible price points: an initial price of $60, and three discounted prices of 10% off ($54), 20% off ($48), and 40% off ($36).![image](https://github.com/sugarocket/Sales-Forecasting-and-Revenue-Management/assets/78404450/b6473224-4f19-446a-aa91-e5b17562a28c)
